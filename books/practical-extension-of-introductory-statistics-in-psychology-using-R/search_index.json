Additionally, this book will extend more advanced univariate statistics in psychology into the GLM framework. Ekarin Eric Pongpipat, M.A. Chapter 1 Introduction Typically, introductory univariate statistics courses in psychology cover the following inferential analyses (plus or minus a few more analyses): One Sample t-test Dependent Samples t-test Independent Samples t-test One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) Factorial ANOVA Correlation Simple Linear Regression These conventions may be useful for quickly talking about a particular statistical analyses with others; however, thinking of these analyses as derivatives (or special cases) of the GLM (i.e., ordinary least squares [OLS] regression) lends itself to understanding more advanced statistical techniques. Given that, the book will provide some evidence along with R code for others to see how the aforementioned analyses can be analyzed within the GLM framework with identical answers. The GLM is not a new idea, but an idea that needs emphasizing. 1.1 What exactly is the GLM? The general linear model is a unified statistical framework that allows us to think about all of the above analyses (and much more) with a single concise formula: \\(Y = \\beta X + \\varepsilon\\) where \\(Y\\) represents a dependent variable (DV) or a set of DVs, \\(\\beta\\) represents a set of regression coefficients in addition to the constant, \\(X\\) represents an independent variable (IV) or a set of IVs, and \\(\\varepsilon\\) represents the error around the model. This should look familiar as the formula is similar to the simple linear regression formula or the slope-intercept form learned in algebra. 1.2 How will this book be covered? We will go over each of the typical introductory statistics taught in psychology in five steps: State the null and research hypotheses Perform the statistical analysis in R Statistical decision (using an alpha (\\(\\alpha\\)) = 0.05, two-tailed, which is the artribrary and ubiquituous convention in psychology) APA statement (bare minumum) Visualization For each analysis, the traditional approach will be performed first followed by the GLM approach for steps 1 and 2. To goal is show the similarities and differences between stating the null and research hypotheses in step 1 as well how the analayses are identical using both approaches in step 2. 1.3 What won’t this book cover? This book won’t go into assumptions of inferential tests or exhaustively its respective formulas. This book will also not exhaustively review data manipulation, transformations, visualization in R as there are other books that already do this well (e.g., R for Data Science by Wickham &amp; Grolemund) "]
