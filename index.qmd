I am interested in understanding the relationship between brain architecture (e.g., networks and gradients) and cognition, and how this relationship can change as we age and for different groups of individuals (e.g., disease-disorder states and genetic predispositions). Iâ€™m also interested in statistics, research methods, intuitive data visualization, and open science practices (open source code, open data, and open publication access).
